        <p>I am Portia Medina. I am currently a 20-year old IT student who resides in Sta Ana, Pampanga. 
        I learned how to edit videos in 6th grade and that has been my favorite hobby ever since. 
        In addition, I love eating desserts like pancakes and listening to songs that usually have a 
        genre of rock or electropop.</p>
